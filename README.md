The following files represent:

binary_classifier2.pth - model for binary classification of nuclei on the basis of photo quality
model.ipynb - model notebook with part of metrics
ROC_matric_only.ipynb - ROC and error matrix of the model
classifier.ipynb - notebook directly for classification of available photos into two folders on the basis of photo quality
featuresss_by_cut_neuro.ipynb - first attempt to extract features from photos for the purpose of subsequent visualisation (unsuccessful, the idea of applying the weights of the last layer of the efficientnet_b0 architecture was used)
fichi_by_mahotas.ipynb - second attempt to extract features from photos for the purpose of further visualisation of differences in nuclei at different days of differentiation (successful, mahotas python package was used).
